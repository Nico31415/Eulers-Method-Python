# Eulers-Method-Python
This is a program which will graph a function given its derivative and a point. You will also be asked h, which is the number of iterations. The more iterations, the more accurate the program will be. I am currently working on asking the user for the function, but for now, the user will have to type it himself where it is defined, in terms of x and y.
